# Blockchain study

A collection of Python code that I am utilizing as steps in the process of studying blockchain.

## steps
The beginning:

Key Components of a Blockchain - A blockchain relies on two cryptographic primitives for many of its security properties:

cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures.

 1)Hash Function and 2) Digital Signature

 Hence level 1 and level 2
 
```python

level1.py explores simple python hashing
level2.py utilizes pip package pycryptodome==3.9.8
to leverage RSA public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt
```

As my studies continue other files and folders will be added to chronicle my learnings.
